Toads are a common name for frogs that have dry, bumpy skin and stout bodies with short legs. Most toads are members of the family Bufonidae, and they can be found in a wide range of geographic locations. This care sheet outlines basic care needs for a variety of pet toad species, including: 

African bouncing toads 

Egyptian toads 

Moroccan green toads

Toads are amphibians, not reptiles. However, like reptiles, amphibians are ectothermic (or “cold-blooded”) animals that rely on external heat sources to regulate their body temperature.   

Some toad species are silent, while others are highly vocal. Certain species will communicate with each other through calls that sound like chirps, snores, sneezes, or even a sheep’s bleat. 

Toads can serve as great first-time pets. Be sure to check your state laws to ensure you can own at toad before purchasing one.

Most toads are nocturnal, meaning they are more active at night, and they will spend their days burrowed under the substrate, (bedding) in their tank. 

Toads are intelligent animals that learn to recognize patterns and routines over time. Because of this, it’s best to feed toads at the same time every day rather than vary their feeding schedule. 

Pet toads live significantly longer than wild toads.
